# AIR-PolSAR-Seg

We build a challenging PolSAR terrain segmentation data set called AIR-PolSAR-Seg with higher data scale and scene complexity. The data set is open to the community to provide support for research in the field of PolSAR terrain segmentation.

## Introduction
The presented AIR-PolSAR-Seg contain 500 full-polarization SAR images with a size of 512x512 and each image has 4 kinds of polarization modes, including the HH,HV,VH,and VV. Therefore, the total number is 2000. These full-polarization SAR images are provided by the Gaofen-3 satellite at quad-polarized strip I (QPSI) mode. The spatial resolution is 8m, and it is annotated with respect to 6 categories at pixel level.
